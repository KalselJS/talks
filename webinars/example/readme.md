### Title

Getting Started to Js

### Description

JavaScript fatigue has been on the rise for a while now. You often hear developers complain that the front-end world is moving too fast, there are too many frameworks to choose from and too many things to learn all at once. While I agree there is truth to that, I also know that continuous learning and improvement is an inevitable aspect of being a programmer.

### Category

### Audience

People who interested about JS

### Abstract

#### Bab I

What is javascript

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and executed automatically as the page loads.
Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

#### Bab II

What make Javascript Unique

JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.

That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.

While planning to learn a new technology, it’s beneficial to check its perspectives. So let’s move on to the modern trends affecting it, including new languages and browser abilities.

#### Bab III

Ecosystem

#### Bab IV Languange over javascript

The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different people want different features.

That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.

So recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are transpiled (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.

Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under the hood”.

Examples of such languages:

CoffeeScript is a “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.
TypeScript is concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the development and support of complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.
Dart is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps). It was initially offered by Google as a replacement for JavaScript, but as of now, browsers require it to be transpiled to JavaScript just like the ones above.

#### Bab V

JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but is now used in many other environments as well.
Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language with full integration with HTML/CSS.
There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.
